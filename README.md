# Tic Tac Toe Game
The game was built in Unity C#, designed using proper software engineering and OOP principles.

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking spaces with their respective symbols ( 'X' and 'O') until one player successfully aligns three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until the grid is full, resulting in a draw. The game requires strategy and foresight to outmaneuver your opponent and secure a winning combination.

In addition you can save and load a game state data from
the selected storage types: In-memory (application memory) and PlayerPrefs and continue from the point where the game stopped.
